I have selected the application of web advertising system that benefits from a database and built a database application from start to finish.

Philosophy: Building a full database application from scratch allows you to control the process; instead of having the pieces decided for you, you must make all of the decisions by yourself. Part of this process is that you will see how design decisions made at the beginning will affect your final project.

Goals
• Deciding on an application for which database systems would be required
• Modelling the domain of the application, and defining the application functionalities
• Designing and implementing the schema
• Populating the database (this should not be the main focus of the project)
• Writing code needed to embed the database system in an application that has a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
